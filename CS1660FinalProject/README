I could not get a version of jupyter notebook to work but here are the urls of the images I am currently using including the current jupyter notebook image on my cluster.

https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/jupyter-base-notebook-ppc64le
https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube
https://hub.docker.com/r/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker
https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/spark

The steps to get the images on a kubernetes cluster running
  - Create the cluster on gcp
  - Connect to the cluster through the gcp console
  - Create deployments for each
